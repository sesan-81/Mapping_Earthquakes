# Mapping_Earthquakes

(1)	PROJECT OVERVIEW

               The purpose of the Analysis
               
A non-profit organization whose mission is to report data-backed stories about disasters around the world has provided the opportunity to work with their data to build data visualizations with interactive features. The project involves using JavaScript and APIs to visually tell a story about earthquakes around the world.

(3)	SUMMARY

APIs used in this assignment was provided by MapBox to create interactive maps. Using these APIs in combination with the Leaflet JavaScript library, enables easy and highly customizable map creation. The earthquake data was collected from the U.S. Geological Survey website containing data from earthquakes worldwide over the past week. This data was extracted and loaded as a GeoJSON file, a type of JSON data specifically designed to hold geographical information. The final map contained the earthquake data represented as circular markers with their size and color corresponding to the magnitude of the earthquake. Each marker also has a popup that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake. The map also contains multiple viewing layers (i.e. satellite, street) and the ability to toggle visibility of the earthquake data.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION


 Three types of map can be viewed using the drop-down menu. Screenshots from the website are taken as shown below:
